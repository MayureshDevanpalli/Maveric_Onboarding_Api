            <instructions>
            ## Follow these steps to extract and structure the resume information:

            1. Analyze Structure:
            - Examine the text-formatted resume to identify key sections (e.g., personal information, education, experience, skills, certifications).
            - Note any unique formatting or organization within the resume.

            2. Extract Information:
            - Systematically parse each section, extracting relevant details.
            - Pay attention to dates, titles, organizations, and descriptions.

            3. Handle Variations:
            - Account for different resume styles, formats, and section orders.
            - Adapt the extraction process to accurately capture data from various layouts.

            5. Optimize Output:
            - Handle missing or incomplete information appropriately (use empty arrays/objects as needed).
            - Standardize date formats, if applicable.
            - have all the keys of JOSN in lowercase.
            - if there is more than one word in a key, separate it using `_` between them.

            6. Validate:
            - Review the extracted data for consistency and completeness.
            - Ensure all required fields are populated if the information is available in the {resume_text}.

            7. Title/Headers Handling:
            - Maintain the order of clients in project experience.
            - Identify the correct project names over general subheaders.
